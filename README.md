# Generation-Ireland
Some projects I worked one during my Generation UK and Ireland bootcamp in Data Analytics. 

1. Interim Project
  - Tasked to answer questions in relation to the AdventureWorks2019 sample database by Microsoft using SQL Server and python.
  - We had to deliver a presentation and 20 page report.
  - We split up the task into primarily focusing on one question each but assisted each other along the way. 
  - Here is my answer to [Question-03](/Question-03): What is the relationship between Country and Revenue?
